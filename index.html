      <h2>About Doggy Dogpark</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Doggy Dogpark is the most luxurious dogpark that you'll ever take your doggy to.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Built with state-of-the-art fake grass absorption technology and automatic pooper-scooper robots, you don't have to worry about your dog's potty breaks within the facility. On top of that, with our patented <em>auto-fetch robots</em>, you don't even have to waste your time playing with your dog. This allows you and your family to have the time to do something more important in your life rather than playing with your dog. After all, <strong>time is money!</strong>
